# Work Log

## GROUP MEMBER 1 - Dua Baig

### 5/22/2024

- I worked on the structure of the abstract parent class for the cubes. I also wrote the constructor, as well as some accessor methods.

###  5/23/2024

- I wrote the skeleton of classes Cube2x2 and Cube 3x3. I also wrote the scramble method both cubes will use.

## 5/24/2024 - 5/27/2024
- I wrote helper methods for the turn methods of the cubes, also worked on setup().


## 5/28/2024
- I started work on turn methods for cube (turnRow).

## 5/29/2024
- I added methods to draw the cubes for the simulation (methods drawCubeFace and drawCubes).

### 5/30/2024

- Completed methods turnFace and turnRow, only turnCol left for cube movement.

### 5/31/2024 - 6/2/2024
- Completed methods for turning the side and front columns. Also wrote overarching turnmethod and added keyPressed for input.

### 6/3/2024 - 6/4/2024
- Fixed bugs in turn methods (some faces were reversing when they shouldn't be), starting on solve.

### 6/5/2024 - 6/7/2024
- Attempted to implement solve for 2x2. No commits because it wasn't working the way I wanted it to (screwed up the cube itself), so I kept rewriting the function. I found out on Friday it wasn't working right because I put a wrong value within the row movement function, so the cube just all started turning one color when I would try to turn the bottom face counterclockwise multiple times.

## 6/8/2024
- Added history of movements list to simulator (lack of commits due to spending the day at a wedding).
